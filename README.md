Remote Sensing of Foliar Nitrogen in Californian Almonds
========================================================

Welcome to this GitHub page! Here, you can find my master's thesis which I wrote in Davis, California in 2022/23 to earn a master's degree in agricultural science from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, ZÃ¼rich (ETHZ).Note that [the web version](https://damian-oswald.github.io/master-thesis/) of this thesis differs slightly from [the PDF version](https://damian-oswald.github.io/master-thesis/Remote-Sensing-of-Foliar-Nitrogen-in-Californian-Almonds.pdf) that I submitted at April 28, 2023 -- mainly because the web version uses colored graphics, and because some minor content was rearranged for a better legibility and user experience.Both the web version as well as the PDF document of this thesis were created with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). Quarto is an amazing open-source scientific and technical publishing system that can be used to create reproducible books, simple articles, entire websites and much more. To reproduce the thesis, you can clone the repository and subsequently render the quarto project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/damian-oswald/master-thesis
cd master-thesis
quarto render
